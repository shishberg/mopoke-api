# Mopoke API server

Mopoke is (or will be) a task management system, mainly aimed at individual or family to-do lists but with the eventual idea that it could be used to run, for example, a kanban board.

This repo is the API server. There is also a CLI at https://github.com/shishberg/mopoke-cli.

Very much a work in progress.
